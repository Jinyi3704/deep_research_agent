# Agent Module

This module contains the core agent logic and reasoning capabilities.

## Suggested Implementations

- **ReAct Pattern**: Reasoning and Acting in an interleaved manner
- **Chain of Thought**: Multi-step reasoning processes
- **Task Planning**: Break down complex research tasks
- **Tool Orchestration**: Decide which tools to use and when
- **Response Generation**: Format and present research findings

## Getting Started

Trainees should implement agent classes here that coordinate between the LLM, tools, memory, and knowledge base to perform deep research tasks.

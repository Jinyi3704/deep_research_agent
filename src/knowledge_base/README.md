# Knowledge Base Module

This module manages the agent's knowledge storage and retrieval system.

## Suggested Implementations

- **Document Storage**: Store and index research documents
- **Vector Database**: Implement semantic search over documents
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: Retrieve relevant context for queries
- **Source Management**: Track citations and sources

## Getting Started

Trainees should implement knowledge base classes here to give the agent access to external information and research materials.

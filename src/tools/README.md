# Tools Module

This module contains tools and functions that the agent can use to interact with external systems.

## Suggested Implementations

- **Web Search**: Integration with search APIs (Google, Bing, etc.)
- **Web Scraping**: Extract content from web pages
- **Calculator**: Perform mathematical computations
- **Code Execution**: Run code snippets safely
- **File Operations**: Read/write files for research

## Getting Started

Trainees should implement tool classes here following a consistent interface that the agent can call dynamically.
